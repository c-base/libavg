libavg 1.5.0.pre2 - November 3, 2010

  svn revision 5263

  Major New Features:
    * Nodes can be constructed directly from python, making createNode unnecessary.

    * Node constructors have a parent parameter which makes a following addChild 
      redundant.
    * Added Player.setEventHook().
    * Added onscreen keyboard for touchscreens.
    * WordsNode.getNumLines(), .getCharIndexFromPos(), .getTextAsDisplayed().

    * Added ImageNode.compression for 16 bpp texture support.
    * Added avg_audioplayer.py.

    * Various compiler compatibility fixes: Compiles with gcc 4.5 and VC++ 2010 now.

libavg 1.0.0 - January 8, 2010

  svn revision 4489

  New Features:

    * hinting is now optional in words node.
    * Multitouch emulation module added to AVGMTApp.
    * masks now work with words nodes.
    * Added video.volume property and video.hasAudio() method.
    * Added AVG_LOG_CATEGORIES environment variable. Log configuration is now
      done using the environment and not by calling a method.
    * Added maskpos and masksize attribute so masks can be moved and rescaled.
    * Added Player.getKeyModifierState()
    * Added sse2 version of yuv->rgb color conversion.
    * Added avg_videoinfo.sh.
    * Added mesh node.
    * Added avg_showcamera --resetbus to reset the firewire bus after crashes.

  Other Improvements:
    * New anim framework is now stable.
    * Snow Leopard compatibility.
    * avg_showcamera has much better command line handling.
    * The test suite is faster and a lot more comprehensive.
    * hrefs and mediadirs are now unicode-aware, so filenames like "รถ.png" 
      should work.
    * node.unlink(True) now deletes all event handlers in the node, making
      it a lot easier to avoid memory leaks. 
    * Lots of bug fixes:
      - Windows gamma is now reset correctly on program end.
      - Linux vsync now much more stable.
      - Setting node.pos.x now throws an error instead of being ignored. 
        Same for all other Point2D attributes.
      - video.getNumFrames() now returns the exact number of frames.
      - Behaviour of nodes before Player.play() and when they are not in the
        avg tree is now much more stable.
      - Fixed words node sensitive area for centered and right-aligned nodes.

libavg 1.0.0.pre3 - January 6, 2010

libavg 1.0.0.pre1 - December 21, 2009

  svn revision 4387

libavg 0.9.0 - August 23, 2009

  svn revision 4100

  Major new features:

    * Support for vector node types: Line, PolyLine, Curve, Circle, Polygon,
      Rectangle. Vector nodes can be textured, with the closed vectors taking two
      textures: one for the outline, one for the fill. Vector drawing is GPU-based.
    * Plugin support. Plugins written in C++ can define complete new node types.
    * Powerful (but still experimental) new animation framework.
    * Unified & much more stable camera drivers. Consistent support for all 
      resolutions & framerates we could test. Support for more than one camera on all
      platforms. fw800 is supported.
    * Uniform support for aggregate types in node interfaces (node.pos, node.pivot, 
      ...)

  Other improvements:
    * gcc 4.4 and ffmpeg 0.5.0 compatibility.
    * Added letterspacing support to words node.
    * Threaded videos are now the default.
    * Improved video seek and loop performance.
    * New Node::getElementByPos() method that returns the node at that point on the
      screen.
    * Added avg.svnrevision and avg.svndate properties so the avg version can be 
      queried.
    * New avg_showfont.py utility to help font selection.
    * New avg_showcamera.py utility to help camera setup.
    * New avg.getMemoryUsage function that returns the resident set size.
    * New Words.addFontDir().
    * Added support for mipmapping node textures, including videos.
    * rasternode.maskhref to support static alpha masks for any videos, word nodes,
      etc.

  Syntax and semantic changes:
    * In the course of adding aggregate types for node attributes, several attributes
      have changed:
      - words.size is now called words.fontsize.
      - pivotx and pivoty have been replaced by pivot.
    * right-aligned and centered words nodes are positioned differently.
    * avgtrackerrc syntax has changed significantly; see src/avgtrackerrc.minimal.
    * Support for firewire cameras using libdc1394 ver. 1 has been phased out. Please 
      install ver. 2.x.
    * The old python-based anim framework is marked deprecated. You need to explicitly
      use the namespace anim to access it.
