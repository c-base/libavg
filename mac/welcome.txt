After the installer runs, please make sure that everything works by running the tests. To do this, open a terminal, cd to /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/libavg/avg/test and call ./Test.py. You should see some test graphics flicker on the screen. The last message in the terminal should read 'OK'.

We welcome your feedback. See http://www.libavg.de/ for details.
