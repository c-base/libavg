    .. autoclass:: AVGNode

        Root node of an onscreen avg tree. Defines the properties of the display
        and handles key press events. The AVGNode's width and height define the
        coordinate system for the display and are the default for the window
        size used (i.e. by default, the coordinate system is pixel-based).

        .. py:method:: __init__([onkeydown: string, onkeyup: string])

            :param string onkeyup:

                Name of python function to call when a key up
                event occurs.

                .. deprecated:: 1.5
                    Use :func:`VisibleNode.setEventHandler()` instead.

            :param string onkeydown:

                Name of python function to call when a key
                down event occurs.

                .. deprecated:: 1.5
                    Use :func:`VisibleNode.setEventHandler()` instead.

    .. autoclass:: AreaNode

        Base class for elements in the avg tree that define an area on the screen.
        Responsible for coordinate transformations and event handling. See 
        http://www.libavg.de/wiki/index.php/Coordinate_Systems
        for an explanation of coordinate systems and reference points.
        
        .. py:method:: __init__([x, y, pos, width, height, size, angle, pivot])
        
        .. py:method:: getMediaSize() -> avg.Point2D

            Returns the size in pixels of the media in the node. Image nodes
            return the bitmap size, Camera nodes
            the size of a camera frame and Words nodes the amount of space
            the text takes. Video nodes return the video size if decoding has
            started or (0,0) if not. Decoding starts after :py:func:`play` or 
            :py:func:`pause`
            is called and the node can be rendered.

        .. py:attribute:: x

            This is the horizontal position of the node's reference point 
            relative to it's parent node. 

        .. py:attribute:: y

            This is the vertical position of the node's reference point 
            relative to it's parent node. 

        .. py:attribute:: pos

            This is the position of the node's reference point 
            relative to it's parent node. 

        .. py:attribute:: width

        .. py:attribute:: height

        .. py:attribute:: angle

            The angle that the node is rotated to in radians. 0 is
            unchanged, 3.14 is upside-down.

        .. py:attribute:: size

            The size that the node takes on the canvas. Node types usually have sensible
            defaults for the size. For media nodes, this is generally the size of the
            media (so :samp:`size == getMediaSize()`). For DivNodes, the default size is
            infinite.

        .. py:attribute:: pivot

            The position of the point that the node is rotated around.
            Default is the center of the node.


    .. autoclass:: CameraNode

        A node that displays the image of a camera. The attributes correspond to the 
        camera properties in .avgtrackerrc and are explained under
        http://www.libavg.de/wiki/index.php/Tracker_Setup. An easy way to find the 
        appropriate parameters for your camera is to use :command:`avg_showcamera.py`.

        CameraNodes open the camera device on construction and set the chosen camera 
        parameters immediately.

    .. autoclass:: DivNode

        A div node is a node that groups other nodes logically and visually.
        Its positino is used as point of origin for the coordinates
        of its child nodes. Its extents can be used to clip the children if crop is set 
        to True. Its opacity is used as base opacity for the child nodes' opacities.
        The children of a div node are drawn in the order they are found
        in the avg file, so the first one is below all others in z-order.
        
        .. py:method:: __init__([crop=False, elementoutlinecolor, mediadir])

            this div and all its div children in the specified color (given in html hex
            format). Turn off by setting the color to the empty string.

        .. py:attribute:: mediadir

            The directory that the media files for the children of this node are
            in. Relative mediadirs are taken to mean subdirectories of the parent node's

        .. py:method:: removeChild(i)

            Removes the child at index i from the div. Note that as long as other
            references to the node exist, the node is not deleted.

        .. py:method:: reorderChild(oldIndex, newIndex)

            Moves the child at oldIndex so it's at newIndex. This function
            can be used to change the order in which the children are drawn.

        .. py:method:: reorderChild(node, newPos)

            Moves the child node so it's at index newPos. This function
            can be used to change the order in which the children are drawn.

            string.

    .. autoclass:: ImageNode

        A static raster image on the screen. The content of an ImageNode can be loaded
        from a file. It can also come from a :py:class:`Bitmap` object or from an 
        :py:class:`OffscreenCanvas`. Alpha channels of the image files are used as
        transparency information.

        .. py:method:: __init__([href, compression])

        .. py:attribute:: compression

            The texture compression used for this image. Currently, :py:const:`none`
            and :py:const:`B5G6R5` are supported. :py:const:`B5G6R5` causes the bitmap 
            to be compressed to 16 bit per pixel on load and is only valid if the source 
            is a filename. Read-only.

        .. py:attribute:: href

            In the standard case, this is the source filename of the image. To use a
            bitmap as source, call setBitmap().  To use an offscreen canvas as source, 
            use the :samp:`canvas:` protocol: :samp:`href="canvas:{id}"`.

        .. py:attribute:: sensorwidth

            The width of the sensor used to make the image. This value
            is used together with sensorheight and focallength to
            determine the projection to use.

        .. py:method:: getScreenPosFromPanoPos(panoPos: Point2D) -> Point2D

            Converts a position in panorama image pixels to pixels in coordinates
            relative to the node, taking into account the current rotation angle.

        alpha masks (:py:attr:`maskhref`, :py:attr:`maskpos`, :py:attr:`masksize`), 
        several blend modes that define how compositing is done and mipmapping suport.

        Any Raster Node can have a GPU-based effect added to it by using 
        :py:meth:`setEffect`.

        In addition, RasterNodes can be warped. By default, a RasterNode is rectangular.
        However, it can be subdivided into a grid of reference points using 
        :py:attr:`maxtilewidth` and :py:attr:`maxtileheight`. The position of each of 
        these points can be changed with :py:meth:`getOrigVertexCoords`, 
        :py:meth:`getWarpedVertexCoords` and :py:meth:`setWarpedVertexCoords`, 
        yielding arbitrary shapes.
        
        .. py:method:: __init__([maxtilewidth, maxtileheight, blendmode, mipmap, maskhref, maskpos, masksize, gamma, contrast, intensity])

        .. py:attribute:: maxtilewidth

            it. Valid values are :py:const:`blend`, :py:const:`add`, :py:const:`min` 
            and :py:const:`max`. For :py:const:`min` and :py:const:`max`
            blend modes, opacity is ignored.

        .. py:attribute:: maskhref

            The source filename for a mask image to be used as alpha channel.
            Where this file is white, the node is shown. Where it is black, the
            node is transparent. If the node is an image with an alpha channel,
            the alpha channel is replaced by the mask.

        .. py:attribute:: maskpos

            An offset for the mask image. For images and videos, the offset is
            given in image or video pixels, respectively. For words nodes, the
            offset is given in screen pixels. If portions of the node extend
            outside the mask, the border pixels of the mask are taken.

        .. py:attribute:: masksize

            The size of the mask image. For images and videos, the size is
            given in image or video pixels, respectively. For words nodes, the

            Determines whether mipmaps (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap) are 
            generated for this node. Setting this to True improves the quality of 
            minified nodes. Depending on the graphics card in use, turning on mipmaps
            may cause a performance hit for every image change. Read-only.

        .. py:attribute:: gamma

            Allows node-specific gamma correction. gamma is a triple that
            contains separate float values for red, green, and blue. A gamma value of
            1.0 in all channels leaves the image unchanged. Higher gamma values
            increase, lower values decrease the brightness. In all cases, black
            white pixels are not affected by gamma. See also 
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction.

        .. py:attribute:: intensity

            A control for the brightness of the node. intensity is a triple
            that contains separate float values for red, green, and blue. An intensity
            value of 1.0 in all channels leaves the image unchanged. This value
            corresponds to the photoshop brightness value.

        .. py:attribute:: contrast

            A control for the color contrast of the node. contrast is a triple
            that contains separate float values for red, green, and blue. A contrast
            value of 1.0 in all channels leaves the image unchanged.
