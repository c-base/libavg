================

Welcome to the libavg reference documentation. This documentation describes the syntax 
and semantics of the library. As a reference, it aims to be exact and complete. It is not
intended to be an informal introduction to libavg - for this, have a look at 
http://www.libavg.de/wiki/ProgrammersGuide.
